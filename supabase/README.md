# Supabase

## Purpose

This folder brings the FluentStellar learning system's live Supabase schema
under version control. Before this existed, the schema, RLS policies, and
the two learning RPCs (`complete_new_word_study`, `complete_word_review`)
lived only in the Supabase dashboard — unreviewed, undiffable, and with no
record of who changed what.

## Current state: catalog-confirmed baseline

`migrations/20260804192152_baseline_existing_learning_system_schema.sql` is
an as-is snapshot of the live schema, assembled from a read-only
database-security audit (catalog queries run directly against the live
project's `pg_attribute`/`pg_class`/`pg_constraint`/`pg_policies`/`pg_proc`
— via `format_type()`, `pg_get_expr()`, `pg_get_functiondef()`, and
`aclexplode()` — not `information_schema`, and not a live `supabase db
pull`, since no database password or CLI access token was available in the
environment that produced it). It deliberately does not fix anything it
describes.

**Everything in the migration is [CATALOG-CONFIRMED]** — exact column
types/nullability/defaults, exact constraint names, exact RLS policy text,
exact RPC bodies, and exact table/function grants (including `PUBLIC` vs.
named roles and `WITH GRANT OPTION`, via direct ACL introspection). Both
RPCs' `EXECUTE` grants are confirmed: `complete_new_word_study` and
`complete_word_review` both grant `EXECUTE` to `postgres`/`anon`/
`authenticated`/`service_role`, none `WITH GRANT OPTION`.

**Postgres version:** 17, confirmed (also independently corroborated by the
`MAINTAIN` privilege appearing in this project's grants — that privilege
didn't exist before Postgres 17).

### Confirmed grant facts

- **All four tables** (`user_profiles`, `user_word_progress`,
  `user_daily_stats`, `review_events`) grant the *full* privilege set —
  `INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, TRUNCATE, REFERENCES, TRIGGER, MAINTAIN`
  — to **all four roles**: `postgres`, `anon`, `authenticated`, and
  `service_role`. None are `WITH GRANT OPTION`. This is broader than "some
  broad privileges" — it's the complete standard table-privilege set,
  including several (`TRUNCATE`, `REFERENCES`, `TRIGGER`, `MAINTAIN`) the
  application never uses at all.
- **This means RLS is the *only* thing protecting any of these tables.**
  The grant layer itself provides zero independent defense in depth — for
  `review_events` specifically, the only reason `anon`/`authenticated`
  can't touch it directly is that RLS is enabled with zero policies. If a
  single permissive policy were ever added to that table without equal
  care, the grants underneath are already wide open to receive it.
- No column-level grants exist anywhere on any of the four tables —
  confirmed via `aclexplode(pg_attribute.attacl)` returning zero rows.
  Every grant is table-wide.
- Both RPCs' `EXECUTE` grants: confirmed — `complete_new_word_study` and
  `complete_word_review` both grant to `postgres`/`anon`/`authenticated`/
  `service_role`, none `WITH GRANT OPTION`.

### Known imperfections this baseline intentionally preserves

Do not "fix" these by editing the baseline migration. They are documented
here so the next migration can address them deliberately, one at a time:

1. **`user_word_progress` and `user_daily_stats` RLS is ownership-only,**
   and the grant layer gives `authenticated` every privilege needed to
   exploit that. `FOR ALL USING (auth.uid() = user_id) WITH CHECK
   (auth.uid() = user_id)` restricts *whose* row can be touched, not
   *which columns or values*. An authenticated user can bypass both RPCs
   and `PATCH` their own `word_state`, `correct_streak`, `next_review_at`,
   or daily counters directly — self-data-integrity risk, not a cross-user
   privacy issue (every table's cross-user isolation was separately
   confirmed safe).
2. **No non-negative `CHECK` constraints** on `user_word_progress.
   correct_streak` or `user_daily_stats`'s three counter columns.
3. **`review_events.user_id` has no foreign key**, and
   `review_events.word_progress_id`'s foreign key has no specified
   `ON DELETE` behavior (defaults to `NO ACTION`).
4. **`anon` holds `EXECUTE`** on both RPCs unnecessarily — both already
   reject unauthenticated callers internally, so this is an extra,
   unneeded privilege layer rather than a live gap.
5. **Excessive table-level grants across the board** (see above) —
   `TRUNCATE`/`REFERENCES`/`TRIGGER`/`MAINTAIN` granted to `anon`/
   `authenticated` on all four tables with no application need for any of
   them.

### Promotion thresholds — confirmed intentional, not a bug

`complete_word_review` implements `seen→learning: 1`, `learning→familiar: 2`,
`familiar→strong: 3`, `strong→mastered: 4` consecutive correct reviews,
matching `src/data/learning/reviewOutcomeTransition.ts` exactly. This is the
correct, deliberate, cross-layer-consistent design — captured as-is.

### Two things surfaced by this audit that are genuinely open questions

Neither is a schema defect by itself — both need a short follow-up outside
this baseline task:

1. **`user_profiles.is_new_user`** (`boolean not null default true`) exists
   and is not read or written anywhere in the frontend TypeScript reviewed
   across this audit. Purpose/ownership unknown.
2. Some live `user_profiles` columns (`nickname`, `native_language`,
   `learning_language`, `current_level`, `user_age`, `birth_month`,
   `birth_day`, `last_active_at`) are `NOT NULL` in PostgreSQL, while the
   corresponding frontend read types (`UserProfilesRow` in
   `src/lib/userProfile.ts`) may permit `null`. This baseline preserves the
   live schema as deployed and does not resolve that application/schema
   contract question — whether it has any practical effect depends on the
   account-onboarding write path, which is out of scope for this baseline
   and was not audited here.

## What happens next

Corrective changes are separate, individually-reviewed follow-up migrations
— never folded into the baseline above. See the numbered list at the bottom
of the migration file itself for the current proposed order.

## Working with this folder going forward

- Make schema changes as new files under `migrations/`, named
  `<timestamp>_<description>.sql` — never by editing a migration that's
  already been applied anywhere.
- Avoid editing tables, policies, functions, or grants directly in the
  Supabase dashboard. If a dashboard edit is unavoidable (an incident fix,
  for example), capture it in a matching migration file immediately
  afterward rather than letting the dashboard and this folder drift apart.
- `config.toml`'s `major_version = 17` is now confirmed correct (see
  above), not just the CLI's own template default.
